아래 논문이 top conference 인 AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2023) 에 accept 되었습니다.<br>AAAI은 BK21 최우수국제학술대회목록에서 impact factor (IF) 4점으로 인정 받는 computer science (CS) 분야의 최상위 학술대회입니다.<br>축하합니다.<br>Title: LANCER: A Lifetime-Aware News Recommender System<br>Author: Hong-Kyun Bae, Jeewon Ahn, Dongwon Lee, Sang-Wook Kim<br>Abstract<br>From the observation that users reading news tend to not click outdated news, we propose the notion of ‘lifetime’ of news, with two hypotheses: (i) news has a shorter lifetime, compared to other types of items such as movies or e-commerce products; (ii) news only competes with other news whose lifetimes have not ended, and which has an overlapping lifetime (i.e., limited competitions). By further developing the characteristics of the lifetime of news, then we prenset a novel approach for news recommendation, namely, LifetimeAware News reCommEndeR System (LANCER) that carefully exploits the lifetime of news during training and recommendation. Using real-world news datasets (e.g., Adressa and MIND), we successfully demonstrate that state-of-the-art news recommendation models can get significantly benefited by integrating the notion of lifetime and LANCER, by up to about 40% increases in recommendation accuracy.
